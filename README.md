Mini Project 2 - BAN 5743 - Go Pokes

## Problem Statement
The problem which we worked upon is a Deposit opening classification problem.The objective of the classification is to identify clients who will 
subscribe (yes/no) for a term deposit. (Variable y: Target function). The Bank wants us to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to 
identify relationships, trends in data. For example: correlations, bivariate analysis of target versus input variables, facts, univariate 
patterns and missing data.

## Dataset information:
1. Data is about an XYZ bankâ€™s direct marketing campaign. Marketing 
campaigns were driven by telephone calls.
2. Data Set In many cases, more than one contact for the same client 
was required., in order to access if the product (deposit) would be 
('yes') or not ('no') subscribed
3. The purpose of the classification is to forecast whether the customer 
will signup (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y).
4. The dataset: XYZ_Bank_Deposit_Data_Classification.csv, 20 
entries/columns, sorted by date between May 2008 and November 
2010.
